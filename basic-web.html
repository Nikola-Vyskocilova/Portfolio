    <section class="on"><h6>This assignment was quite broad because I had to use everything we had learned in the Basic Web theme so far. I first built the mobile version of my website which was about the art style that was given to me. I had to do desk research on that style and write articles. After creating the mobile version I already had a moodboard, color scheme and I learned about typography and typefaces, copy and microcopy, Gestalt principles and Fibonacci spiral. I also created my logo and icons in Illustrator by sketching them and then got my hands on Adobe XD to create a prototype for the desktop version.</h6>


        <p>We learned about different layout patterns such as Mostly fluid, Column drop, Tiny tweaks, Layout shifter, and Off-canvas. In this assignment, I decided to use Column drop because my desktop version contained only 2 columns and it seemed the most logical for me to just shift things from the 2nd column under things in the 1st column. </p>

    <section class="two"> <h6>I used gestalt principles such as proximity and common region because I wanted it to be really easy for the user to use the website.</h6>

        <p>There was a requirement to use media queries where my breakpoints were min 900px for desktop view and max 600px for my smaller screen after doing research on different sizes of devices. These sizes seemed the most used.</p>

    <section class="thre"> <h6>I had to do some sketches of wireframes which I did for the mobile view as well as the desktop view. I sketched my own logo and then some icons.</h6></section>

    <section class="four">

    <h6>We learned about Usability testing and specifically trunk-test which we tried ourselves and it helped me realize and see some imperfections of my website which I was not able to see.</h6>
