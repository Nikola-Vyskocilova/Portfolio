    <h1>04.01.01 Sprite animation on a background </h1>

        <section class="twtw">
            <h6>In this assignment the goal was to create a character in illustrator and animate it with CSS. Firstly we got to choose our inspiration do a desk research and create a moodboard. </h6>

        <section class="twth">
            <h6>
            Then we learned how to sketch by doing different exercises and thenstarted sketching our character. My character is inspired by a Kawaii style.
            </h6>

        </section>

        <div class="sketch"><img src="ccatus.JPG" width=400 alt=picture></div>

        <section class="twfo">
            <h6>
                After being done with sketches we learned how to create the character in illustrator by using shapes. When working in illustrator I combined working with shapes and creating my own shapes because for example creating the cactus´ pricks with existing shapes was not an option for me.
            </h6>

        </section>

        <div class="character"><img src="cactus.jpg" width=300 alt=picture></div>

        <section class="twfi">
            <h6>
              Creating a sprite animation after being done with the character was a fun experience. I got to choose what I wanted my character to do. I chose waving because walking is not possible when my cactus doesn’t have legs and he only has one arm so waving it is. </h6>

                <p>I used a method of stacking a couple of copies of my characteron top of each other and modeling his hand to look like he is waving whichcreated the sprite animation.

        <section class="twsi">
           <h6>
                Then we sketched our background and again created it in Illustrator. I used my knowledge of colors and contrast to make my character stand out.

            </h6>

        </section>

        <div class="background"><img src="IMG_7545.JPG" width=400 alt=picture></div>



        <section class="twse">
            <h6>
                I then put my sprite animation into HTML and created an animation with CSS.</h6>
                <p>
I learnt how important it is sometimes to create a moodboard to collect inspiration for your project.</p>
<p>I gained new skills in CSS, advanced code for animation and improved my Illustrator skills.

        <div class="JS"><h1>04.02.01 Javascript controlled animation </h1></div>

        <section class="twei">
           <h6>
                This assignment was about creating 10 animations for our character which could be turned on and off which had to be controlled by Java script. </h6>

            <p>This was hard at the beginning because I had to learn new coding language which was Java Script. CSS animations were also new for me. </p>
            <p>We learned about CSS transitions, transforms such as skew and scaling. I used all of this in my animation. I learned how to use keyframes to make it all work. </p>
            <p>I used some of my CSS knowledge from previous assignments such as change color of a button after being clicked to show which one is active.

        <section class="twni">
            <h6>
               Then SVG animation was shown to us. We learned how to make an outline of a city forexample or how to make a text write itself or an object to draw itself. I decided to make a border drawing itself around my header. I was thinking about the text writing itself because I found specifically this one really cool but I also wanted it to be a certain font so I decided for the border.

          </h6>

            <p>Another new for me was a sound in HTML and later controlled by JS which as it turned out was really easy to do.</p>

        <section class="th">
            <h6>
                This assignment was in pairs again and this time we had to create a Java Script controlled project that we had to submit on the same day which meant we had to work quickly. This time we were not distributing the work but we worked together on the code which seemed to work better for us because JS was still new to us so we put together our knowledge.

            </h6>

        <section class="thon">
            <h6>
            We chose to work on Drum Machine where we created buttons with the key you are supposed to press to play a certain sound, so it is obvious for the user which key is for which sound. The current button scales up and you can see a glowing blue border so the users know which sound they are playing. It is also possible to play the sound twice in a row.</h6>

                <p>We added the function for playing the sound twice because it only seemed logic when in real life you can play the sound as many times in a rowas you want. It was a bit difficult at the beginning but we managed to figureit out.
            </p>

        <div class="drum"><img src="drum.PNG" width=400 alt=picture></div>

        <section class="thtw">
            <h6>
                Again, we used some of our previous knowledge for border color or scaling up a button, playing a sound. We learned new codes for JS as well as improving the ones we already knew.

            <h6>
                The goal ofthis group project was to help new international students in Denmark to feelmore integrated in Danish society by creating an Onboarding with game elements where the user could learn about Danish culture and Danes to become part of their community. </h6>
                <p>My main role was a coordinator and an Illustration creator which I did by using shapes and image tracing in Illustrator to create some of the backgrounds you can see in our onboarding.

                I also created the Persona collage where I used some of my Photoshop skills such as shadows, borders, opacity and blur. After that we created a Storyboard together.

            <h6>
                At the beginning we distributed the work between us to creating the content, coding and Illustrator. After we were done with content and Illustrator all of us helped doing some coding, my main role here was creating the sprite animations and GIFs which was new thing I learnt.

            </h6>

        </section>

        <div class="gif"><img src="map-gif2.gif" width=400 alt=picture></div>

        <section class="thsi">
            <h6>
            We learnt about some of the game elements such as lives, points, progress bar to indicate levels, stars, time or batches. We decided to go with a progress bar, quizzes and price after taking the quiz
            </h6>

        </section>

        <div class="bar"><img src="bar.PNG" width=400 alt=picture></div>

    <section class="thse">
        <h6>
            We decided to make it from the users point of view, so he is going through all of the situations with our other and only physical character, his guide, Jonas. He is introducing the Danish culture and habits.

        </h6>

        </section>

        <div class="jonas"><img src="jonas.PNG" alt=picture width=400></div>

        <section class="thei">
            <h6>

            We used a lot of our skills and knowledge from previous projects such as style tile, moodboard, HTML, CSS and JS coding, Illustrator, Sprite animation, Storyboard, Photoshop and so on. I found it really useful that we had to combine all of thethings we had already learned.</h6>

            <p>New things I learned were GIFs in Photoshop, Image tracing in Photoshop and new codes in JS, more advanced code for creating interactive elements. And also improved my copy and microcopy skills.</p>
