        <section class="thni">
            <h6>
                Our goal was to create a campaign website that could be useful for Foodsharing and would help them with food wasting problem. My main role was a coordinator, implementor and later on I edited the video in Premiere Pro.

                Firstly we decided to go with the food-wastingproblem and our target audience were mostly house-holds as there is it theworst as we discovered after doing our desk research.  We then created our title, theme, logline, andtreatment. After that, we focused on story board and location scouting whichafter we created the storyboard wasn’t hard at all because we only needed 2places – bathroom and kitchen. </h6>

                <p>We shot the video from the viewers' point of viewso he feels like he is part of the story and he is also the antagonist. Becauseof that, we decide to use GoPro to shoot it.

                Then we focused on creating the website. We first started with prototype in Adobe XD which we previously used in Prototype and Design Sprint. As there were really no strict rules we could use everything we had learnt so far. We created a CSS animation which is a circle of outline of Copenhagen that is spinning to catch the attention of the user. We made some icons in Illutrator, desk researched tips on reducing food waste and put it all together using HTML and CSS.

            <h6>
                For social media we shot a short clip which is actually a boomerang which draws a lot of attention. It is supposed to say that even the food you are about to throw out can still be good enough to use and still can be saved.

            <h6>
                I learned how to edit sound in Adobe Audition whichwas really useful in this project as we didn’t use microphones during shooting.Learned how to correct colors in Premiere pro and improved my editing skills as I had already worked in Premiere pro before. And I learned how to work with a real customer which was really exciting.

        <div class="storyboard"><h1>05.02.03 “Storyboard”</h1></div>

        <section class="fofo">
           <h6>
                Creating the storyboard definitely helped us with developing the idea and making it good enough to shoot. We decided on shots, the order of the shots as well as the dialogue which made it easier for us in the future to shoot it. As we discussed it with teachers, we changed our final story from the first idea completely. Creating storyboard made us realize that some of our ideas were irrelevant to our story and that they didn’t really fit into the context and it was still easy to change instead of having to reshoot all of it.

            <h6>
                Thanks to the storyboard I learned to start with something catchyto attract viewers and decide which ideas on shot include in order for the viewerto not get bored.

        <div class="pitch"><h1>05.02.04 “Customer pitch”</h1></div>

        <section class="fosi">
           <h6>
                The goal of our customer pitch was to attract our customer which was Foodsharing Copenhagen and present our idea in easy and interesting way. </h6>

                <p>According to Simon Sinek, it is important to start with why then how and lastly what because people are interested in the company beliefs.And that is how we started as well, to catch the attention of the customer and to make him understand why we created our campaign and video in particular.

            </p>

        </section>

        <section class="fose">
            <h6>
            We started by creating a Golden circle with Why(motivation), How (process) and What (product). We had a really short time to create it which helped us concentrate on only important things and to try getting deeper to really find the Why.</h6>

                <p>
            Then we presented it to 2 different persons who gave us some interesting feedback which helped us later when creating the pitch itself because they said what was relevant to them and what was not. After that we adjusted our golden circle to its final stage where our Why was even deeper and raw because we were told by one of the persons that we were still not quite there.

            </p>

        </section>

        <div class="circle"><img src="IMG_7923.JPG" width=400 alt=picture></div>

        <section class="foei">
            <h6>
                After adjusting the golden circle we had 30 minutes to create the pitch on spot and the pitch was supposed to last 7 minutes. I believe that the time pressure really helped us to focus and got us going. It was quite tough at the beginning but after one of us started the next one continued and after while the ideas were just flowing. After being done each of us took a piece of the pitch to present it the same day in front of the class. That was helpful as well because our classmates were giving us feedback on what they just heard, what was good and what should be improved. We continued working on our pitch after the presentation based on our classmates´ feedback. We created a short presentation about 3-4 slides just so the customer had something visual while listening to us and we put there some of the most important bullet points of our pitch.

                I learned how to present just a little bit better and how to create a short precise and interesting pitch for customers.
