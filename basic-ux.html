    <h1>03.01.01 - Data collection</h1>

        <section class=fi>
        <h6>This assignment consisted of 4 methods of research – Desk research, Observation, Interview and Survey on the chosen topic. For Desk research, I chose Cyberbullying because it is current and I was really interested in learning about that. For Observation, I chose the Kitchen culture to see how people act and behave in a queue in a supermarket. For the interview, I chose Hobby or interest and I questioned one of my friends which I hadn't known for a long time back then and it was really interesting learning new stuff about her and lastly, for the Survey I investigated if international people are feeling excluded when they are around Danes. </h6>
        </section>

        <section class="si">
        <h6>I already did desk research in 02.04.01 Responsive website where we researched the given style so I just searched the internet about cyberbullying and saved everything interesting I found even though I never used some of it. </h6>
        </section>


        <section class="se"><h6>The observation was something new I learned by immediately trying it myself which was really useful and necessary. I stood 30 minutes in a supermarket in a rush hour and observed people standing by the register. I took notes and pictures. </h6></section>

                In thisassignment we were also introduced to Interview and were said there are different types of interviews such as formal, informal, structured,semi-structured and unstructured. I went for informal because I already knew that person and semi-structured because I wanted to ask questions based on the answers of the interviewee. I was said some helpful tips, for example to show interest, make the interviewee comfortable, to maintain eye-contact and to record the whole interview so we can go back and listen to it again and also so we pay attention during the interview and are not making notes which I did and found it really helpful.

                Survey was also new to me and I learned that it is structured and formal, it can be really helpful to create questions based on what answers I want to get and that we must start with easier questions and then follow with the harder ones. To create our survey we used Google forms which also have a graphical presentation.

                After that I had to write a page about every method and then take only the most important parts and make a small presentation with only 1 slide per 1 method.

        <section class="el">
          <h6>
                This assignment was about creating a prototype of a website for international students in Copenhagen to find housing, job, and friends which we were already familiar with from 02.04.01 Responsive website. The only difference was that this project was in pairs. We had to distribute the work between us and my main focus was job and social pages. We also got to choose what part we wanted tofocus on.

           </h6>

        </section>

        <section class="twel">
            <h6>We started by researching conventions regarding design, content and functionality on different sites about searching for job, accommodation and about social life such as dating apps. </h6>

                <p>In Basic Web we learnt about color theory, color symbolism and contrast and that’s why we used yellow because it is a happy color and it creates a good contrast with our main color grey which means reliability.</p>

                What was also new to us was going from low-fidelity using UI kits to high-fidelity by modifying them based on our style tile.

            </h6>

            <p>
                Based on our research we decide for example to place menu on the upper left side, log in button on the upper right side and side bar on an accommodation on the left side because of past experience of users.

                We were introduced to UX-testing such as trunk-test whichwe already did in 02.04.01 Responsive website, 5-second test, User interview and Thinking Aloud Test. We did the Thinking Aloud Test as well as the 5 seconds test because we wanted to be sure everything is clear to the user. 4 people tried our Thinking aloud test and we got some interesting responses and tips to the future, for example, to make some of the links or buttons different color because of the contrast was odd which made us focus more on the contrast but we were surprisedthat most of the people we asked didn’t have problems completing the taskquickly. </h6>

                <p>I also learnt how to make web-forms

                Our goal was to create an app for KEA students where all ofthe events organized by KEA were posted which will result in higher attendanceand maybe even more organization teams. My part was a plant and later assetcollector, so I did a lot of desk research about different events at KEA, theorganizers and I collected pictures as well as a lot of sketching because I was the one that was supposed to come up with a logo and icons.

                This assignment was only for a week which seemed like a little time to create a prototype of an app. Plus the tasks were divided intodays. On Monday we did a Map where we specified our long-term goal then sprintquestion where we asked ourselves where we might fail and finally How might wenotes where we first thought about how it could work and look like.

                Tuesday was all about sketching. Firstly we did the four-stepsketch where we wrote down some of our ideas how we wanted the app to work and look like individually and then we circled the 2 most promising ones. Then we did the crazy 8´s which was a really quick exercise of sketching 1 idea per 1minute. This was time to go crazy and think outside of the box and trysomething new. We then pinned our sketches to the wall and started sharing ourideas. Every person had 3 minutes to present it. Then each of us voted for 3ideas that we liked the most. After that, we anonymously created 3-panelstoryboard with the ideas we voted for but this time with words as well.

                On Wednesday we decided which ideas we will use and which we will leavefor later. We followed 5 steps – Art museum, Heat map, Speed critique, Strawpoll, and Supervote. After that we were left with an idea and created astoryboard and we started prototyping our app in Adobe XD

           Thursday was a testing day where we were asking experts. Inour case, it was an organizer so we questioned the Tech Lounge and the 3rdsemester student.  We had to come up with questions and we based them on our long-term goal and our HMW. Then we interviewed 3 people and showed hem our prototype, giving them tasks while watching what they were doing. Rest of the team was taking notes on post-its which we later stuck on a wall organized in groups. We later did some changes to our prototypes such as changing colors or a sign-up page and we added some ofthe things to our future improvements.

            <h6>
                We pitched our app on Friday in front of our classmates and also got some feedback from them.</h6>

                <p>I learned the importance of storyboard because when we started prototyping it was really quick because we knew exactly what we wanted to do. I later used storyboard in Copenhagen Foodsharing as well as in Onboarding </p>

            <p>
                I realized that pitching is going to play a big part in our studies because we used it in 05.02.01 “Foodsharing Copenhagen” as well so I learn how to say only the important things because there is not enough time to present your product in detail.
